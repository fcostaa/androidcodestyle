{"name":"Android Coding Guidelines","tagline":"Android Coding Guidelines","body":"# Android Coding Guidelines\r\n\r\nThis document contains the coding guidelines for the Android Development. It contains four major sections:\r\n\r\n- Style Guidelines, on how to organize your source code.\r\n- Git Workflow Changes, discusses how Git workflow works.\r\n- Source Code Control, details our source code control use.\r\n- Best Practices, used in the Android Development.\r\n\r\n## Style Guidelines\r\n\r\nIn order to keep the code consistent, please use the following conventions. From here on `good' and `bad' are used to attribute things that would make the coding style match, or not match. It is not a judgment call on your coding abilities, but more of a style and look call. Please try to follow these guidelines to ensure prettiness.\r\n\r\nYou may also wish to read the [Code Conventions for the Java Programming Language](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/codeconv-138413.html) as well, however the Android guidelines below take precedent for Java code if there is a conflict.\r\n\r\n# Naming Conventions\r\n\r\n1. Use Meaningful Names\r\n\r\nChoose names that suggest their purpose. Good names help you understand the problem you are solving.\r\n\r\nGood:\r\n\tint count;\r\n    \r\nBad:\r\n\tint i;\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Variable Names\r\n\r\nStart with a lower-case letter and use uppercase letters as separators. Do not use under bars ('_').\r\n\r\nGood:\r\n\tint myVar;\r\n    \r\nBad:\r\n\tint my_var;\r\n    \r\n3. Constant Names\r\n\r\nUse all capital letters and use under bars ('_') as separators.\r\n\r\nGood:\r\n\tfinal int MY_CONST = 1;\r\n    \r\nBad:\r\n\tfinal int myConst = 1;\r\n\r\n\r\n4. Method Names\r\n\r\nStart with a lower-case letter and use uppercase letters as separators. Do not use under bars ('_').\r\n\r\nGood:\r\n\tint myMethod();\r\n\r\nBad:\r\n\tint My_Method();\r\n\r\n5. Class Names\r\n\r\nStart with an upper-case letter and use uppercase letters as separators. Do not use under bars ('_').\r\n\r\nGood:\r\n\tpublic class MyClassName\r\n\r\nBad:\r\n\tpublic class MyclassName_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
